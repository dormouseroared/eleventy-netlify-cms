Hello here is the body of the first blog post
## heading
more guff

## problem with image

put a random image in the root images/uploads for the featured image but it didn't get moved to the _site folder. This may need a restart for the eleventy config to kick in. The good news is that a manual copy of the image does result in the featured image appearing.

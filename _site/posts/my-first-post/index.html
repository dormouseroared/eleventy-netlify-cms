<p><p>Hello here is the body of the first blog post</p>
<h2>heading</h2>
<p>more guff</p>
<h2>problem with image</h2>
<p>put a random image in the root images/uploads for the featured image but it didn't get moved to the _site folder. This may need a restart for the eleventy config to kick in. The good news is that a manual copy of the image does result in the featured image appearing.</p>

<h2>and here it is again using markdown</h2>
